# 1Short - One PHP File URL Shortener

Saw some random youtube shorts, showing how [remoteok.com](https://remoteok.com/) was developed using only `index.php`, so I tried to make something with only single PHP file.

#### Setup

Make sure docker is installed, then run the following command
```
docker compose up -d
```
